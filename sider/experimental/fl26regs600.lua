fl26regs -- regulation records: the live count follows fl26caps' cap (300 -> 600).

GENERATED FILE by mkregs.py.  Every 'old' below was read from the exe at that address.

Set:     regs600
Summary: regulation records 600: live recount in place, re-initialisers and the 0x140fbdc70 walk raised, 4 patches

fl26caps grows the regulation array to 600 records, but the game recounts its records
after every mode-copy write-back, at mode-data creation and on load (0x1414bc0a0), and that
recount is unrolled six records a pass over 50 passes: it never looks past record 300.  The
array is sorted by key, so with more than 300 regulations the highest keys (late cup and
European ties) stop being found and are left out of the Master League save.  This module
makes the recount cover all 600, and moves the three other bounds still at 300 (the two
in-place re-initialisers and one walk's back edge).

Needs fl26caps.lua with a regulation cap of exactly 600, loaded BEFORE this module: it
checks the block constructor and destructor and writes nothing if they do not say 600.
Touches no byte fl26caps, fl26slots, fl26hdr* or fl26regfast touch.  Allocates no page.
A career saved with this module carries more than 300 regulations; load it with it.

Install:
  1. copy this file to <game>\SiderAddons\modules\fl26regs600.lua
  2. sider.ini, after lua.module = "fl26caps.lua":   lua.module = "fl26regs600.lua"
  3. start the game; sider.log says "fl26regs: applied all ..."
