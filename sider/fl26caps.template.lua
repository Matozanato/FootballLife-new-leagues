fl26caps -- runtime patch applier for the FL26 array-capacity work.

GENERATED FILE. Do not edit: it is produced by tools/patchset.py from patches/<set>.json
and sider/fl26caps.template.lua. Editing it by hand loses the guarantee that every byte
below came from disassembling the instruction at that address.

Set:     --[[SET]]
Summary: --[[SUMMARY]]

What it does, and the one rule it follows: read every target address first and compare it
against the bytes the generator saw in the exe; only if all of them match does it write
anything. A half-applied layout is worse than no patch at all, so a single mismatch aborts
the whole set and the game runs unmodified.

Sider's Lua sandbox does not provide `pcall` -- no shipped module uses it, and the first
version of this file died on it at startup, before writing anything. So nothing here is
wrapped: the verify pass only reads, and it runs to completion before the write pass
begins. If a call does fail, Sider logs the error and does not activate the module, which
during the verify pass simply means the game runs unmodified.

Install:
  1. copy this file to <game>\SiderAddons\modules\fl26caps.lua
  2. add to sider.ini, in the [modules] list:   lua.module = "fl26caps.lua"
  3. start the game and read sider.log -- it says exactly what happened

The exe has no ASLR (DllCharacteristics 0x8120), so the addresses are absolute and stable.
The applier checks that anyway by verifying the bytes.

  -- The patch has to land before the game allocates the edit block, and the log proves
  -- that it does: everything above is written during module init, which Sider finishes
  -- before it reports "Sider initialization complete", and the first `read_file::` line
  -- comes thousands of lines later. An earlier version of this file also registered a
  -- livecpk_get_filepath handler to re-read the first site at the first file request. It
  -- worked, but it made Sider log "lua ERROR from module_get_filepath" on every single
  -- file lookup -- 27811 of them in one session -- so it is gone. The ordering was never
  -- in doubt; the check was.
